the JDK 21 came out, we already had some insight into how the virtual threads looked like earlier with the preview flag. However with a proper release now it is more accessible and I encourage everyone who can to upgrade to this version. \n\nThe version consists of a lot of different features such as:\n\nSequenced Collections (JEP 431)\nGenerational ZGC (JEP 439)\nRecord Patterns (JEP 440)\nPattern Matching for switch (JEP 441)\nVirtual Threads (JEP 444)\nKey Encapsulation Mechanism API (JEP 452)\n\nAnd much more that is currently in preview, like unnamed classes which is similar to what Kotlin does. I might check that out for a new article another time. Exciting times!\nIntroduction\nVirtual threads are lightweight threads that are cheap to create and almost infinitely plentiful. That means that they are an implementation of threads that are provided by the JDK rather than the operating system (OS).&nbsp;\nIn previous versions, threads were limited due to the fact that JDK implemented a wrapper around the operating system (OS) threads aka platform threads. So the cost of using threads was high, so we could not have too many of them.\nIn this article we are going to discuss what virtual threads is all about, as well as implementing platform threads and virtual threads and to compare performance between the two.\nWe are also going to take a look at how the scheduling works, how we now can take advantage of thread-per-request strategy once again but without the higher costs it can bring, thread pools and why you should not use it with virtual threads, memory use and interaction with garbage collector and lastly thread-local variables. \nVirtual threads vs. platform&nbsp;threads\nSo what are virtual threads really and how do they differ from platform threads?\nAs mentioned in the introduction, platform threads act as a wrapper around the operating system (OS) threads. The JDK's virtual thread scheduler assigns the virtual thread for execution on a platform thread by mounting the virtual thread on a platform thread. In other words, the platform thread is basically the carrier of the virtual thread.\nVirtual threads are not by any mean faster threads. They do not run any code faster than platform threads. They do however provide scale (higher throughput) but not speed (lower latency).\nVirtual threads can significantly improve application throughput when:\n\nThe number of concurrent tasks is high\nThe workload is not CPU-bound. Having more threads than processor cores cannot improve throughput in that case.\n\n\n  \n\nImplementation\nWe will implement a task-processing system using platform threads to establish a performance baseline. Afterwards, we will create an equivalent system using virtual threads and compare the throughput of both implementations to evaluate the benefits of virtual threads.\nWe start off by creating the Buffer class which represents a shared buffer that facilitates communication between producers and consumers. Producers add tasks to the buffer, and consumers retrieve and process these tasks. The class ensures thread safety and efficient coordination among threads.\npublic class Buffer {\n    private LinkedList&lt;String&gt; data;\n    private int capacity;\n\n    public Buffer(int capacity) {\n        this.data = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();\n        this.capacity = capacity;\n    }\n\n    public synchronized void produce(String task, String producerName) {\n        while (data.size() &gt;= capacity) {\n            try {\n                wait();\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n            }\n        }\n        data.add(task);\n        System.out.println(producerName + \" produced \" + task);\n        notifyAll();\n    }\n\n    public synchronized String consume(String consumerName) {\n        while (data.isEmpty()) {\n            try {\n                System.out.println(consumerName + \" is waiting for tasks.\");\n                wait();\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n            }\n        }\n        String task = data.removeFirst();\n        System.out.println(consumerName + \" consumed \" + task);\n        notifyAll();\n        return task;\n    }\n}\n\nHere we have the constructor that initializes a Buffer instance with a defined capacity:\npublic Buffer(int capacity) {\n    this.data = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();\n    this.capacity = capacity;\n}\n\nIn the produce method, we ensure thread-safe access to a shared buffer by employing synchronization. First, we check if the buffer has reached its capacity to prevent overfilling. If the buffer is full, the producer thread enters a waiting state to allow other threads to run. \nException handling is used to address potential interruptions during this wait. Once the waiting period concludes, the producer adds the new task to the buffer and logs a message indicating successful task production. A notification is sent to awaken other waiting threads, such as consumers, signalling the availability of new tasks. \npublic synchronized void produce(String task, String producerName) {\n    while (data.size() &gt;= capacity) {\n        try {\n            wait();\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n        }\n    }\n    data.add(task);\n    System.out.println(producerName + \" produced \" + task);\n    notifyAll();\n}\n\nIn the consume method, we establish synchronized access to a shared buffer to ensure thread safety. This method is designed for consumers to retrieve and process tasks from the buffer in a coordinated manner. Initially, the method checks if the buffer is empty, which prompts the consumer thread to enter a waiting state while displaying a message indicating that it's waiting for tasks. \nException handling is employed to handle any potential interruptions during this waiting period. When tasks become available in the buffer, the consumer retrieves the next task, logs a message indicating successful consumption, and then notifies other threads (producers and consumers) about the buffer state change. \npublic synchronized String consume(String consumerName) {\n    while (data.isEmpty()) {\n        try {\n            System.out.println(consumerName + \" is waiting for tasks.\");\n            wait();\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n        }\n    }\n    String task = data.removeFirst();\n    System.out.println(consumerName + \" consumed \" + task);\n    notifyAll();\n    return task;\n}\n\nLet's create our Producer and Consumer class that implements the Runnable interface:\npublic class Producer implements Runnable {\n    private Buffer buffer;\n    private String name;\n    private int numTasksToProduce;\n\n    public Producer(Buffer buffer, String name, int numTasksToProduce) {\n        this.buffer = buffer;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.numTasksToProduce = numTasksToProduce;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= numTasksToProduce; i++) {\n            buffer.produce(\"task \" + i, name);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Consumer implements Runnable {\n    private Buffer buffer;\n    private String name;\n    private int numTasksToConsume;\n\n    public Consumer(Buffer buffer, String name, int numTasksToConsume) {\n        this.buffer = buffer;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.numTasksToConsume = numTasksToConsume;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        int tasksConsumed = 0;\n        while (tasksConsumed &lt; numTasksToConsume) {\n            buffer.consume(name);\n            tasksConsumed++;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWithin this method of the Consumer class, a consumer aims to consume a predefined number of tasks. It maintains a count of the tasks consumed. In each iteration of the loop, the consumer calls the consume method on the shared Buffer object, passing its name as a parameter. \n@Override\npublic void run() {\n    int tasksConsumed = 0;\n    while (tasksConsumed &lt; numTasksToConsume) {\n        buffer.consume(name);\n        tasksConsumed++;\n    }\n}\n\nPlatform threads\nNow let's create the PlatformThreads class:\npublic class PlatformThreads {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int numProducers = 1_000;\n        int numConsumers = 1_000;\n        int totalTasks = numProducers * 100;\n\n        Buffer buffer = new Buffer(totalTasks);\n\n        long startTime = System.nanoTime();\n\n        Thread[] producerThreads = new Thread[numProducers];\n        Thread[] consumerThreads = new Thread[numConsumers];\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numProducers; i++) {\n            producerThreads[i] = new Thread(new Producer(buffer, \"Producer \" + (i + 1), totalTasks / numProducers));\n            producerThreads[i].start();\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numConsumers; i++) {\n            consumerThreads[i] = new Thread(new Consumer(buffer, \"Consumer \" + (i + 1), totalTasks / numConsumers));\n            consumerThreads[i].start();\n        }\n\n        try {\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; numProducers; i++) {\n                producerThreads[i].join();\n            }\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numConsumers; i++) {\n            consumerThreads[i].interrupt();\n        }\n\n        try {\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; numConsumers; i++) {\n                consumerThreads[i].join();\n            }\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        long endTime = System.nanoTime();\n\n        double elapsedTimeSeconds = (endTime - startTime) / 1e9;\n\n        System.out.println(\"Performance Metrics:\");\n        System.out.println(\"Elapsed Time: \" + elapsedTimeSeconds + \" seconds\");\n        System.out.println(\"Total Tasks Processed: \" + totalTasks);\n        System.out.println(\"Throughput (Tasks/Second): \" + totalTasks / elapsedTimeSeconds);\n    }\n}\n\nVirtual threads\nNow let's create the VirtualThreads class. This will basically be very similar to the PlatformThreads class but with some small modifications:\npublic class VirtualThreads {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int numProducers = 1_000;\n        int numConsumers = 1_000;\n        int totalTasks = numProducers * 100;\n\n        Buffer buffer = new Buffer(totalTasks);\n\n        long startTime = System.nanoTime();\n\n        Thread[] producerThreads = new Thread[numProducers];\n        Thread[] consumerThreads = new Thread[numConsumers];\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numProducers; i++) {\n            Runnable producerTask = new Producer(buffer, \"Producer \" + (i + 1), totalTasks / numProducers);\n            producerThreads[i] = Thread.ofVirtual().start(producerTask);\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numConsumers; i++) {\n            Runnable consumerTask = new Consumer(buffer, \"Consumer \" + (i + 1), totalTasks / numConsumers);\n            consumerThreads[i] = Thread.ofVirtual().start(consumerTask);\n        }\n\n        try {\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; numProducers; i++) {\n                producerThreads[i].join();\n            }\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numConsumers; i++) {\n            consumerThreads[i].interrupt();\n        }\n\n        try {\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; numConsumers; i++) {\n                consumerThreads[i].join();\n            }\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        long endTime = System.nanoTime();\n\n        double elapsedTimeSeconds = (endTime - startTime) / 1e9;\n\n        System.out.println(\"Performance Metrics:\");\n        System.out.println(\"Elapsed Time: \" + elapsedTimeSeconds + \" seconds\");\n        System.out.println(\"Total Tasks Processed: \" + totalTasks);\n        System.out.println(\"Throughput (Tasks/Second): \" + totalTasks / elapsedTimeSeconds);\n    }\n}\n\nHere, we are initializing a shared Buffer instance with a specified totalTasks capacity. The buffer acts as a data structure that facilitates the communication and coordination between producer and consumer threads. This shared buffer will allow producers to produce tasks, consumers to consume them, and ensure that the overall processing runs smoothly.\nBuffer buffer = new Buffer(totalTasks);\n\nIn this section, we are creating virtual threads for producers. For each producer, a new Producer instance is created, and a virtual thread is started to execute its task. The producer threads are named based on their index and use the totalTasks value to distribute the workload among the producers evenly. This approach takes advantage of virtual threads, which are more lightweight than traditional platform threads and can efficiently handle concurrent tasks.\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; numProducers; i++) {\n    Runnable producerTask = new Producer(buffer, \"Producer \" + (i + 1), totalTasks / numProducers);\n    producerThreads[i] = Thread.ofVirtual().start(producerTask);\n}\n\nIn this code snippet, we are waiting for all producer threads to complete their tasks by using the join method. If any interruption occurs during this waiting period, it will be caught and printed as an exception. This part of the code ensures that all producers finish their work before moving on to the next steps of the program.\ntry {\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numProducers; i++) {\n        producerThreads[i].join();\n    }\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nHere, we are first interrupting all consumer threads, which means we're signalling them to stop. Afterwards, we wait for all consumer threads to finish their work using the join method. If any interruption occurs during this waiting period, it will be caught and printed as an exception. This part of the code ensures that all consumers have completed their tasks before proceeding with the rest of the program.\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; numConsumers; i++) {\n    consumerThreads[i].interrupt();\n}\n\ntry {\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numConsumers; i++) {\n        consumerThreads[i].join();\n    }\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nPerformance results\nAs you clearly can see, virtual threads are the winner here for running 100,000 or 200,000 tasks with throughput more than double than for platform threads. \nPerformance MetricsElapsed Time (seconds)Total Tasks ProcessedThroughput (Tasks/Second)\nVirtual Threads0.465984125100,000214,599.5853399512\n0.780132208200,000256,366.80289451656\nPlatform Threads1.068746208100,00093,567.5834463405\n2.700846541200,00074,050.85663473095\n\nScheduling virtual&nbsp;threads\nUsing virtual threads means that we will not create platform threads ourselves so we need to understand how a virtual thread gets scheduled to a platform thread to do its work.&nbsp;\nFor platform threads, which are the wrapper around operating system (OS) threads, JDK relies on the scheduler of the OS. In contrast to virtual threads, the JDK has its own scheduler. Instead of assigning virtual threads to the processor directly, the JDK's scheduler assigns virtual threads to the platform threads. Then the platform threads are scheduled by the operating system (OS) as usual.\nThe JDK's virtual thread scheduler is basically a work-stealing ForkJoinPool that is operating in FIFO (first-in-first-out) mode.\n\n  \n\n\nA ForkJoinPool differs from other kinds of ExecutorService mainly by virtue of employing work-stealing: all threads in the pool attempt to find and execute tasks submitted to the pool and/or created by other active tasks (eventually blocking waiting for work if none&nbsp;exist).\n\nThe platform thread to which the scheduler assigns a virtual thread is called the virtual thread carrier. Virtual threads can be scheduled on different carriers over the course of their lifetime. Basically, the scheduler does not maintain affinity between a virtual thread and any kind of platform thread.\nThe scheduler does not at this time implement time sharing for virtual threads. While time sharing can be an effective way of reducing the latency of certain tasks where it could be that there are a small number of platform threads and CPU utilization is at 100%, it is not clear that it would be as effective with a million virtual threads.\nThread-per-request strategy\nTo handle concurrent user requests that are independent of each other, server applications generally have been using a thread-pre-request strategy so that it can handle a request dedicated to a thread under its entire duration.\nThe strategy is easy to understand, easy to implement, debug and profile because it uses the platform's unit of concurrency to represent the application's unit of concurrency.\nUnfortunately, the number of available threads are limited because how the JDK implements threads as wrappers around the operating system (OS) threads. They are costly, so using too many of them would make the implementation ill-suited because it's a limiting factor if we want to focus on throughput before we exhaust CPU or network connections.\nBy using virtual threads this will make this strategy viable since we can now handle much more requests with virtual threads.\nThread pools - why you should not use&nbsp;them with virtual threads\n\n  \n\nMigrating the application code using the virtual-thread-per-task ExercutorService similar to the traditional thread-pool based ExercutorService is not necessary since there is never a need to pool them. A thread pool is like any other resource pool, intended to share expensive resources, but with virtual threads, they are not expensive.\nWe typically use thread pools to limit concurrent access to limited resources. Let's say a service cannot handle more than 20 concurrent requests, we typically make all requests to the service via tasks submitted to a thread pool of size 20 and that will fix it. The high cost of platform threads has made thread pools ubiquitous.\nAvoid using thread pool for virtual threads!\nMemory use and interaction with&nbsp;GC\nJava's garbage-collected heap stores the stacks of virtual threads as chunk objects. It will grow and shrink the stacks as the application runs, both to be memory-efficient and to accommodate stacks of depth up to the JVM's configured platform thread stack size.\nThe amount of activity of the heap space and garbage collector that virtual threads require is hard, specifically when we compare that to asynchronous code. If we would use a million virtual threads, that would be equal to at least a million objects, but so would a million tasks sharing a pool of platform threads.\nThread-local variables\nVirtual threads support thread-local variables, ThreadLocal, and inheritable thread-local variables InhertiableThreadLocal. Just like the platform threads, they can run existing code that uses thread locals. Although use thread-locals after careful consideration since virtual threads can be very numerous.\nWe can use the system property jdk.traceVirtualThreadLocals trigger a stack trace when a virtual thread sets a value of any thread-local variable. With this diagnostic output, it may assist with removing thread-locals if migrating code to use virtual threads. The default value is false.\nSummary\nSo now you probably know a little bit more about Virtual Threads. The tests I conducted could probably be improved, so feel free to contribute to my repo (link below).

This allows an expression to be tested against a number of patterns, each for a specific action. It enables complex data-oriented queries to be expressed concisely and safely.\n\nThis new feature has co-evolved with Record Patterns feature (JEP 440), it proposes to finalize the feature with additional small refinements that are based upon continued experience and feedback. The main changes from the previous JEP are:\n\nRemoving paraenthesized patterns\nAllow for qualified enum constants, case constants in switch expressions and statements\n\nIntroduction\nThe goals of the JDK enhancement proposal were to expand the epressiveness and applicability for switch expressions and statements by allowing patterns to be used in case labels. It allows for historical null-hostility of switch to be more easy when desired. \nIt also increases the safety of switch statements by requiring that the pattern switch statements will cover all the possible input values. As well as ensuring that all exisiting switch expressions and statements will continue to compile with zero changes and execute with identical semantics.\nUnfortunately prior to Java 21, switch was very limited. There was only possible to switch on values of a few types. The corresponding boxed forms, enum types, String (excluding long) and we could only test for exact equality against constants. We might want to use patterns to test the same variable against a number of different possibilities and by taking actions on each one of them, but since the early switch didn't support it, we end up with a chain of if/else.\nA working example prior to Java 21 would be:\nstatic String formatter(Object obj) {\n    String formatted = \"unknown\";\n\n    if (obj instanceof Integer i) {\n        formatted = String.format(\"int %d\", i);\n    } else if (obj instanceof Long l) {\n        formatted = String.format(\"Long %d\", l);\n    } else if (obj instanceof Double d) {\n        formatted = String.format(\"Double %f\", d);\n    } else if (obj instanceof String s) {\n        formatted = String.format(\"String %s\", s);\n    }\n\n    return formatted;\n}\n\nThis might feel familiar, it benefits from using instanceof expression pattern. But it's not good enough. This approach allows for possible coding errors to be remained hidden since we are using an overly general control construct. But using a switch is a perfect match for pattern matching. \nWe can re-write all of the code above to a more clearly an reliable piece of code since extending switch statements and expressions to work on any type allows for case labels with patterns rather than just constants.\nA working example with Java 21 would be:\nstatic String formatterPatternSwitch(Object obj) {\n    return switch (obj) {\n        case Integer i -&gt; String.format(\"int %d\", i);\n        case Long l    -&gt; String.format(\"long %d\", l);\n        case Double d  -&gt; String.format(\"double %f\", d);\n        case String s  -&gt; String.format(\"String %s\", s);\n        default        -&gt; obj.toString();\n    }; \n}\n\nAs you can see, the switch semantics are very clear. A case label with a pattern applies if the value of the selector expression obj matches the pattern. \nWe also see that the intent of the code is much clearer since we are using the right control construct. As a bonus, this code is more optimizable, we are likely to be able to perform the dispatch in O(1) time.\nSwitches and null\nUsing switch statements and expressions traditionally throw NullPointerException if the selector expression evaluates to null, so the testing for null was be done outside of the switch. \nA working example prior to Java 21 would be:\nstatic void testFooBar(String s) {\n    if (s == null) {\n        System.out.println(\"Ouch!\");\n        return;\n    }\n    switch (s) {\n        case \"Foo\", \"Bar\" -&gt; System.out.println(\"Super\");\n        default           -&gt; System.out.println(\"OK\");\n    }\n}\n\nThis was a reasonable approach when switch supported only a few reference types. But, if switch allows a selector expression of any reference type and case labels that can have type patterns. In that case, the standalone null test feels like an arbitrary dinstiction that invites a needless boilerplate and opportunities for errors. \nThe perferable way is to integrate the null test into the switch by allowing a new null case label. \nA working example with Java 21 would be:\nstatic void testFooBar(String s) {\n    switch (s) {\n        case null         -&gt; System.out.println(\"Ouch\");\n        case \"Foo\", \"Bar\" -&gt; System.out.println(\"Super\");\n        default           -&gt; System.out.println(\"OK\");\n    }\n}\n\nWe can always determine null by using it as a case label in the switch. Without a case null, the switch throws NullPointerException, just as in previous Java versions. To keep backward compatibility with the current semantics of switch, the default label do not match a null selector.\nCase refinement\nBy constrast to case labels with constants, we can apply many values by using a pattern case label. \nA working example with Java 21 would be:\nstatic void testString(String response) {\n    switch (response) {\n        case null -&gt; { }\n        case String s -&gt; {\n            if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"YES\"))\n                System.out.println(\"You got it\");\n            else if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"NO\"))\n                System.out.println(\"Shame\");\n            else\n                System.out.println(\"Sorry?\");\n        } \n    }\n}\n\nBy using a single pattern to discriminate among cases is a problem since it does not scale beyond a single condition. It would be preferable if we would write multiple patterns, but then we need a way to express a refinement to a pattern. We therefor allow when clauses in a switch block to specify guards for pattern case labels. \nA working example with Java 21 that we would refer to as guarded case label would be:\nString s when s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"YES\")\n\nBy using that approach we can re-write our existing testString method which will lead to a more readable way:\nstatic void testString(String response) {\n    switch (response) {\n        case null -&gt; { }\n        case String s\n        when s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"YES\") -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"You got it\");\n        }\n        case String s\n        when s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"NO\") -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"Shame\");\n        }\n        case String s -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"Sorry?\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThere is a way we can further enhance this code by some extra rules for other constant strings:\nstatic void testString(String response) {\n    switch (response) {\n        case null -&gt; { }\n        case \"y\", \"Y\" -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"You got it\");\n        }\n        case \"n\", \"N\" -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"Shame\");\n        }\n        case String s\n        when s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"YES\") -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"You got it\");\n        }\n        case String s\n        when s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"NO\") -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"Shame\");\n        }\n        case String s -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"Sorry?\");\n        } \n    }\n}\n\nSwitches and enum constants\nTo use enum constants in case labels is highly constrained at the moment. We need to have an enum type for the selector expression in the switch, it also has to be simple names of the enum constants. \nA working example prior to Java 21 would be:\npublic enum Suit { CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES }\n\nstatic void testforHearts(Suit s) {\n    switch (s) {\n        case HEARTS -&gt; System.out.println(\"It's a heart!\");\n        default -&gt; System.out.println(\"Some other suit\");\n    }\n}\n\nEven if we are adding pattern labels this constraint will lead to unnecessarily verbose code. \nA working example with Java 21 would be:\nsealed interface CardClassification permits Suit, Tarot {}\npublic enum Suit implements CardClassification { CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES }\nfinal class Tarot implements CardClassification {}\n\nstatic void exhaustiveSwitchWithoutEnumSupport(CardClassification c) {\n    switch (c) {\n        case Suit s when s == Suit.CLUBS -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's clubs\");\n        }\n        case Suit s when s == Suit.DIAMONDS -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's diamonds\");\n        }\n        case Suit s when s == Suit.HEARTS -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's hearts\");\n        }\n        case Suit s -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's spades\");\n        }\n        case Tarot t -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's a tarot\");\n        } \n    }\n}\n\nIf we would have a seperate case for each enum constant, we could make this more readable rather than lots of guarded patterns. We could then re-write the above code as:\nstatic void exhaustiveSwitchWithBetterEnumSupport(CardClassification c) {\n    switch (c) {\n        case Suit.CLUBS -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's clubs\");\n        }\n        case Suit.DIAMONDS -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's diamonds\");\n        }\n        case Suit.HEARTS -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's hearts\");\n        }\n        case Suit.SPADES -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's spades\");\n        }\n        case Tarot t -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(\"It's a tarot\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNow there is a direct case for each of the enum constants without using a guarded type pattern.\nEnhanced type checking\nSelector expression typing\nBy supporting patterns in a switch it now means that we can have a relaxed restriction on the type of the selector expression. Currently, the type of the selector expression of a regular switch must be either an integral primitive type (exluding long), the corresponding boxed form such as Character, Byte, Short, Integer, String, or an enum type. \nFor example, in the pattern switch below, the selector expression obj is matched with type patterns that involves a class type, enum type, record type and an array type. As well as a null case label and default.\nA working example with Java 21 would be:\nrecord Point(int i, int j) {}\nenum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE; }\n\nstatic void typeTester(Object obj) {\n    switch (obj) {\n        case null     -&gt; System.out.println(\"null\");\n        case String s -&gt; System.out.println(\"String\");\n        case Color c  -&gt; System.out.println(\"Color: \" + c.toString());\n        case Point p  -&gt; System.out.println(\"Record class: \" + p.toString());\n        case int[] ia -&gt; System.out.println(\"Array of ints of length\" + ia.length);\n        default       -&gt; System.out.println(\"Something else\");\n    } \n}\n\nIn the switch block, for every case label, must be compatible with the selector expression. A pattern label (a case label with a pattern), we use the existing notion of compability of an expression with a pattern.\nDominance of case labels\nSupporting pattern case labels means that for a given value of the selector expression it will be possible now to use more than one case label to apply, whereas in the earlier Java versions we could have at most one case label to be applied. \nOne example would be if the selector expression should evaluate to a String, then both case labels case String s and case CharSequence cs would apply.\nAn example with Java 21 would be:\nstatic void first(Object obj) {\n    switch (obj) {\n        case String s -&gt;\n            System.out.println(\"A string: \" + s);\n        case CharSequence cs -&gt;\n            System.out.println(\"A sequence of length \" + cs.length());\n        default -&gt; {\n            break; \n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe value of obj in this example if it's of type String, then it will apply the first case label. If it would be of type CharSequence, but not the type String then the second pattern label would apply. But let's say we swap the order of these two case labels?\nA working example with Java 21 would be:\nstatic void first(Object obj) {\n    switch (obj) {\n        case CharSequence cs -&gt;\n            System.out.println(\"A sequence of length \" + cs.length());\n        case String s -&gt;    \n            System.out.println(\"A string: \" + s);\n        default -&gt; {\n            break; \n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIf the value of obj now would be of type String the CharSequence case label applies. This is because it appears first in the switch block. The String case label is unreachable since there is no value of the selector expression that could cause it to be chosen.\nExhaustiveness of switch expressions and statements\nType coverage\nBy using a switch expression it requires that all possible values of the selector expression will be handled in the switch block. So to put it to another words, it must be exhaustive. For normal switch expressions, this property is enforced by a set of extra conditions on the switch block. \nFor pattern switch expressions and statements, we achieve this by defining a notion of type coverage of switch labels in a switch block. \nA erroneous example with Java 21 would be:\nstatic int coverage(Object obj) {\n    return switch (obj) {           \n        case String s -&gt; s.length();\n    };\n}\n\nThis switch block only have one switch label, case String s. This pattern switch expressions is not exhaustive because of the type coverage of its switch block does not include the type of the selector expression (Object).\nExhaustiveness in practice\nA erroneous example prior to Java 21 would be:\nenum Color { RED, YELLOW, GREEN }\n\nint numLetters = switch (color) {\n    case RED -&gt; 3;\n    case GREEN -&gt; 5;\n}\n\nThis switch expression over an enum class is not exhaustive since the anticipated input YELLOW is not covered. By adding a case label to handle the YELLOW enum constant is sufficient to make the switch exhaustive, as expected.\nA working example prior to Java 21 would be:\nint numLetters = switch (color) {\n    case RED -&gt; 3;\n    case GREEN -&gt; 5;\n    case YELLOW -&gt; 6;\n}\n\nExhaustiveness and sealed classes\nIf the type of the selector expression is a sealed class, then the type coverage check can take into account the permits clause of the sealed class to determine if a switch block is exhaustive or not.\n\nSealed classes and interfaces restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them.\n\nBy using a sealed class as the selector expression, we can sometimes remove the need for a default clause, which is a good practice. \nAn example with Java 21 would be:\nsealed interface S permits A, B, C {}\n\nfinal class A implements S {}\nfinal class B implements S {}\n\nrecord C(int i) implements S {}\n\nstatic int testSealedExhaustive(S s) {\n    return switch (s) {\n        case A a -&gt; 1;\n        case B b -&gt; 2;\n        case C c -&gt; 3;\n    };\n}\n\nThe compiler can now determine that the type coverage of the switch block is the types A, B and C. Since S, the type of the selector expression is a sealed interface whose permitted subclasses are exactly A, B and C, this switch block is now exhaustive, and thus no need of using a default label clause.\nDealing with null\nA switch traditionally throws NullPointerException if the selector expression evaluates to null. There are, however, reasonable and non-exception-raising semenatics for pattern matching and null values, so we can treat null in a more regular way and still remain compatible with existing semantics. \nIn this new Java version, there is a new null case label. We should however know that:\n\nIf the selector expression would evaluate to null, then any null case is said to match. We throw NullPointerException as before if there is no such label associated with the switch block. \nIf the selector expression would evaluate to a non-null value, then we, as normal, select a matching case label. If there are no case label matches, then any default label is considered a match.\n\nAn example with Java 21 would be:\nstatic void nullMatch(Object obj) {\n    switch (obj) {\n        case null     -&gt; System.out.println(\"null!\");\n        case String s -&gt; System.out.println(\"String\");\n        default       -&gt; System.out.println(\"Something else\");\n    }\n}\n\nWith this given code example, we evaluate null, and print out null! instead of throwing a NullPointerException.\nAn example with Java 21 that can throw NullPointerException would be:\nstatic void nullMatch(Object obj) {\n    switch (obj) {\n        case String s  -&gt; System.out.println(\"String: \" + s);\n        case Integer i -&gt; System.out.println(\"Integer\");\n        default        -&gt; System.out.println(\"default\");\n    }\n}\n\nErrors\nFor example, by matching a value against a record pattern, the record's accessor method can complete abruptly. In this case where we match against a record pattern, pattern matching is defined to complete abruptly by throwing a MatchException. It will also complete abruptly if such pattern appears as a label in a switch block by throwing MatchException. \nIf no label in a pattern switch would match the value of the selector expression, then the switch completes abruptly and throws an MatchException, since it needs to be exhaustive.\nAn example with Java 21 that throws an exception would be:\nrecord R(int i) {\n    public int i() {\n        return i / 0;\n    } \n}\n\nstatic void example(R r) {\n    switch(r) {\n        case R(var i): System.out.println(i);\n    }\n}\n\nThe invocation example(new R(42)) will cause a MatchException to be thrown. \nA second example with Java 21 that throws an exception would be: \nstatic void example(Object obj) {\n    switch (obj) {\n        case R r when (r.i / 0 == 1): System.out.println(\"It's an R!\");\n        default: break;\n    }\n}\n\nThis will throw a ArithmeticException.\nSummary\nSo now you probably know a little bit more about Pattern Matching for switch.

Even harder when it’s a company that focuses on the Web. There is a good reason why this is the case, it’s making life a lot easier for SWE/SRE/DevOps Engineers.\n\nEarlier problems that could be faced were things like “it works on my machine”. Simply put that when deploying on production or on another developer's machine it could behave differently than expected and thus experience problems. Now we can easily say when using Docker “it works on every machine, in the same way”. That’s really good we can now have a certainty of the deliverable that we didn’t have before so we can deliver a good product, especially in production.\nFrom the Wikipedia:\n\nDocker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine. It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.\n\nThis is the Docker Architecture and how it works:\n\n  \n\nIn this tutorial, you will need to understand how Spring Boot works and Gradle in order to understand some build processes.\nPull a Docker image and run a container\nSo from the client (your OS), you are running commands to the Docker Deamon that runs on your computer. You could either set up containers from images, create images, create volumes, create networks and much more. When we run a command such as:\ndocker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres\n\nWhat this does is try to run a container with an image called postgres. We add an environment variable POSTGRES_PASSWORD with its value so PostgreSQL will use that for the postgres default user. Docker then tries to find it locally, if not it will try to pull the image from the configured registry, default Docker Hub. Then it’s trying to start it and we get back a full hash value of the container ID it has been assigned. \nSo when we run docker ps we get the following information here about it:\n\n  \n\nSo here we get the unique container ID, image that we are using, the command that is passed to the container, when the container was created, the current status if it’s up or exited, what port it is listening on and the protocol and the assigned name. \nWe can change the name if we want, this is how we do it with Docker, we just need to change our previous command slightly:\ndocker run --name mydb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres\n\nBut before running that command again we need to remove the existing container since it will be listening on the same port twice. We first have to stop all the running containers.\n\n  \n\nWe then do a clean-up in two different ways (perhaps even more that I’m not aware of). We can do a total clean up like this:\n\n  \n\nYou have to be aware that this removes everything. So it’s not a good way to use this most of the times. But if you feel like you have been doing a lot of things and just want to start from the beginning, this is a good one.\nThere is another more better alternative in most of the cases. We run these commands:\n\n  \n\nSo we just use the command docker rm along with its container name or you can also use the container ID with that command. So you can see that we removed keen_napier here and we only have our new container. Since we stopped all containers we have to start our new one and we can do that by:\n\n  \n\nSo it’s quite easy to just start it again here with the docker start command.\nNow we have a Docker container up and running. There are a lot of things with Docker we could go through here, but we will stick to the basics sort of. When we ran that command to set up PostgreSQL in a Docker container it automatically added a volume for us. \nVolumes are essential when we need to write something, and that is critical when it comes to databases. Docker won’t allow writing in a container so we always need to attach a volume to it. We will go through that soon how to create our own Docker image, but let’s explore how we can view the docker volumes on our computer:\n\n  \n\nWith docker volume ls we are listing all the volumes we have currently. We have two since we didn’t remove the last one. So how do we know which one is attached to the one that is running currently? We can do this by inspecting our current Docker container:\n\n  \n\nHere we see a lot of information about it, this is very useful for troubleshooting.\n\n  \n\nWe scroll down a bit and we can find the Mounts array and we see the volume hash value and we compare that to the one we saw in the previous image 643579a4f6ce50dff92865e7d9163bf3cb16867b7274c2353c859ea86ffeb96. So this is the volume that we need to keep so let's remove the other one since we don’t need it anymore:\n\n  \n\nWe get a confirmation here with the hash value back that it has been removed. Great!\nCreate a Docker image using a Dockerfile\nNow lets look at how to create our own custom Docker image by creating a Dockerfile. As we have been going through Spring Boot before we can try make our Spring Boot application to a Docker image. Clone down the repository: https://github.com/mjovanc/medium-docker-spring (does not exist anymore unfortunately...).\nNow let’s download all the dependencies and build the application, I suggest using IntelliJ for this. Open up the project and then IntelliJ will automatically download everything directly by looking at build.gradle file. Then we need to build it by either running ./gradlew build or pressing the Gradle on the right sidebar in IntelliJ and press double click on build:\n\n  \n\nSo when we have done this we will get a .war file inside ./build/libs/blog-0.0.1.war. This is needed so we can pick up this file with our Dockerfile and add it to the image. So lets create the Dockerfile in the root of the project:\n# Using Tomcat 9.0 since the latest doesn't work with Spring Boot\nFROM tomcat:9.0-jdk16-openjdk\nARG WAR_FILE=build/libs/blog-*.war\nRUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*\nCOPY ${WAR_FILE} /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war\nEXPOSE 8080\nCMD [\"catalina.sh\", \"run\"]\n\nThis is the necessary code for the Dockerfile. We are first using an existing image tomcat:9.0-jdk16-openjdk and then we modify it as we want. We set an argument where the .war file exists, then we remove all .war files inside /usr/local/tomcat/webapps that exists, then we copy that .war file we have created and we place it in that same directory where we deleted all the .war files so Tomcat can use that one. \nWe then expose the container to port 8080 so it can be accessed outside the Docker container on our host OS and then run the shell script catalina.sh with the argument run.\nNow that the code is in place we need to build the image:\n\n  \n\nWe could also build the image and tag it so we get a name and a version to it by running this command:\n\n  \n\nWe have successfully built our first Docker image. Now we just need to start it. And since we already set fallback values for our environment variables in application.yml we don’t need to pass them while starting up the container locally:\ndocker run --name blog-api mjovanc/blog-api:0.0.1\n\nNow the container is up and running! This is a very basic example how to create and run a Docker container.\nUsing Docker Compose to orchestrate\nNow we will look into how we could use Docker Compose to setup both the PostgreSQL and Spring Boot.\n\nCompose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.\n\nRead more about Docker Compose here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/\nIt will make it a little bit easier since we can configure everything in YAML file format. Lets look at this Docker Compose file:\nversion: '3.7'\n\nservices:\n  spring:\n    build: .\n    container_name: blog-api\n    environment:\n      POSTGRESQL_HOSTNAME: postgres\n      POSTGRESQL_PORT: 5432\n      POSTGRESQL_DB_NAME: qryptic_dev\n      POSTGRESQL_DB_USER: postgres\n      POSTGRESQL_DB_PASSWORD: test1234\n      KEYCLOAK_HOSTNAME: keycloak\n      KEYCLOAK_PORT: 11111\n      # This below is optional if you need to specify a specific Spring Boot profile to use\n      # JAVA_OPTS: '-Dspring.profiles.active=dev'\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    links:\n      - postgres\n      - keycloak\n    depends_on:\n      - postgres\n    networks:\n      - blog-net\n\n  postgres:\n    image: postgres\n    container_name: postgres\n    restart: always\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_DB: qryptic_dev\n      POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test1234\n    volumes:\n      - postgres:/data/postgres\n    ports:\n      - \"5432:5432\"\n    networks:\n      - blog-net\n\n  keycloak:\n    image: jboss/keycloak\n    container_name: keycloak\n    restart: always\n    environment:\n      DB_VENDOR: h2\n      KEYCLOAK_USER: admin\n      KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: password\n      PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING: \"true\"\n    volumes:\n      - keycloak:/var/lib/keycloak/data\n      - ./keycloak/realm-export.json:/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-export.json\n    expose:\n      - 11111\n    ports:\n      - \"11111:11111\"\n    command:\n      - \"-b 0.0.0.0\"\n      - \"-Djboss.http.port=11111\"\n      - \"-Dkeycloak.import=/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-export.json\"\n    networks:\n      - blog-net\n\nvolumes:\n  postgres:\n  keycloak:\n\nnetworks:\n  blog-net:\n    driver: bridge\n\nThese things has a lot of things we need to unwrap and go through. We obviously have something called Keycloak here. It’s just for demonstrating how we can go about adding more things here. But for this tutorial I will comment out Keycloak since we will not use it here. But if you are in need to setup Keycloak, here is a good example I’ve been using personally.\nSo lets dig in by looking at the first line in the docker-compose.yml file:\nversion: '3.7'\n\nThis specifies the version we will be using of Docker Compose, syntax could be changed between different versions. Check out documentation of it here: Compose file versions and upgrading\nservices:\n  spring:\n    build: .\n    container_name: blog-api\n    environment:\n      POSTGRESQL_HOSTNAME: postgres\n      POSTGRESQL_PORT: 5432\n      POSTGRESQL_DB_NAME: blogdb_dev\n      POSTGRESQL_DB_USER: postgres\n      POSTGRESQL_DB_PASSWORD: test1234\n      KEYCLOAK_HOSTNAME: keycloak\n      KEYCLOAK_PORT: 11111\n      # This below is optional if you need to specify a specific Spring Boot profile to use\n      # JAVA_OPTS: '-Dspring.profiles.active=dev'\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    links:\n      - postgres\n      - keycloak\n    depends_on:\n      - postgres\n    networks:\n      - blog-net\n\nHere we define what kind of services should be orchestrated. We define spring as a service and adding the path to the Dockerfile, which we set as . (current directory where the docker-compose.yml file exists as well). Then we set the name of the container, if we don’t it will set the name as the service name (spring), then we define all the environment variables we need. \nWe also set what port should be used both internally and externally to expose. We set links to postgres and keycloak service here and we also set a depends_on to the postgres service and that means that first we need to orchestrate up the PostgreSQL database before we start with Spring Boot so it will not fail when starting the application and we define the network it should be connected to. We set all the services to have this network so they can communicate with each other.\npostgres:\n  image: postgres\n  container_name: postgres\n  restart: always\n  environment:\n    POSTGRES_DB: blogdb_dev\n    POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test1234\n  volumes:\n    - postgres:/data/postgres\n  ports:\n    - \"5432:5432\"\n  networks:\n    - blog-net\n\nHere we do the same but defining the PostgreSQL configuration. We specify the image and that will be pulled down (if not already) from the Docker Hub registry. We set the restart to be always, set some environment variables that define what database should be created and what user we will use and set that password. \nWe also define the volume for the container so we can store the data that is saved into the database, the ports as before with the default port number for PostgreSQL and set it to the same network as the spring service.\nkeycloak:\n  image: jboss/keycloak\n  container_name: keycloak\n  restart: always\n  environment:\n    DB_VENDOR: h2\n    KEYCLOAK_USER: admin\n    KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: password\n    PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING: \"true\"\n  volumes:\n    - keycloak:/var/lib/keycloak/data\n    - ./keycloak/realm-export.json:/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-export.json\n  expose:\n    - 11111\n  ports:\n    - \"11111:11111\"\n  command:\n    - \"-b 0.0.0.0\"\n    - \"-Djboss.http.port=11111\"\n    - \"-Dkeycloak.import=/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-export.json\"\n  networks:\n    - blog-net\n\nHere we define the keycloak service to use. Note that we are adding a volume for a realm-export.json, we are attaching that file so we can import the file into the Keycloak instead of manually having to add the configuration to the Keycloak service. We have a command that we add the file to do the import.\nWe are then sending the file in to the Keycloak application so that we will use another port than the standard 8080 since Spring Boot runs on port 8080, so we avoid port collisions.\nvolumes:\n  postgres:\n  keycloak:\n\nnetworks:\n  blog-net:\n    driver: bridge\n\nHere we define the volumes that should exists and the networks with the type of driver that is of type bridge.\nSo that’s an example how to setup Spring Boot, PostgreSQL and Keycloak with Docker Compose. But lets leave out Keycloak for now so I will comment out everything regarding Keycloak so we can test running this now. But first lets remove everything that we have been adding to our Docker before by running these commands:\ndocker kill $(docker ps -q)\ndocker system prune --all\n\nWe now have this updated docker-compose.yml file:\nversion: '3.7'\n\nservices:\n  spring:\n    build: .\n    container_name: blog-api\n    environment:\n      POSTGRESQL_HOSTNAME: postgres\n      POSTGRESQL_PORT: 5432\n      POSTGRESQL_DB_NAME: qryptic_dev\n      POSTGRESQL_DB_USER: postgres\n      POSTGRESQL_DB_PASSWORD: test1234\n      # KEYCLOAK_HOSTNAME: keycloak\n      # KEYCLOAK_PORT: 11111\n      # This below is optional if you need to specify a specific Spring Boot profile to use\n      # JAVA_OPTS: '-Dspring.profiles.active=dev'\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    links:\n      - postgres\n      # - keycloak\n    depends_on:\n      - postgres\n    networks:\n      - blog-net\n\n  postgres:\n    image: postgres\n    container_name: postgres\n    restart: always\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_DB: qryptic_dev\n      POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test1234\n    volumes:\n      - postgres:/data/postgres\n    ports:\n      - \"5432:5432\"\n    networks:\n      - blog-net\n\n#  keycloak:\n#    image: jboss/keycloak\n#    container_name: keycloak\n#    restart: always\n#    environment:\n#      DB_VENDOR: h2\n#      KEYCLOAK_USER: admin\n#      KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: password\n#      PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING: \"true\"\n#    volumes:\n#      - keycloak:/var/lib/keycloak/data\n#      - ./keycloak/realm-export.json:/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-export.json\n#    expose:\n#      - 11111\n#    ports:\n#      - \"11111:11111\"\n#    command:\n#      - \"-b 0.0.0.0\"\n#      - \"-Djboss.http.port=11111\"\n#      - \"-Dkeycloak.import=/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-export.json\"\n#    networks:\n#      - blog-net\n\nvolumes:\n  postgres:\n  # keycloak:\n\nnetworks:\n  blog-net:\n    driver: bridge\n\nNow lets run Docker Compose:\ndocker-compose up\n\nWe can also set the flag -d so we don’t get all real time console output while running the applications:\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nTo stop the Docker Compose we can press CTRL+C. Then we could also to also remove the network that has been created by:\ndocker-compose down\n\nIf using the -d flag we can stop the orchestration by running the command above as well.\nIf we would like to rebuild all images if we made some changes we can run this command:\ndocker-compose up --build\n\nThis will force to rebuild all images.\nPersonally when I’m developing a Spring Boot application it’s very nice to use Docker Compose for setting up everything around Spring Boot such as the PostgreSQL and Keycloak and perhaps even a frontend framework with Angular or React. \nBut sometimes I want to leave out Spring Boot since it would take a lot of time to rebuild the project to generate a .war file then run docker compose again and so forth.\nSo if you are like me and want to leave out Spring Boot while developing you could run this command to skip orchestrating up the Spring Boot:\ndocker-compose up --scale blog-api=0\n\nThis is very handy to use. It’s still good to have spring as a service in Docker Compose since I could clone down the repository then run docker-compose up and everything is orchestrated for me so I can minimize time setting up the project locally to test and so forth.\nSummary\nI feel like knowing Docker it has made me much more productive in my development since I don’t have to waste time setting up systems and development environment manually.\nThere is a lot of other things we can do with Docker and Docker Compose, but I will leave it at this for now, perhaps in an upcoming tutorial I can go a little bit deeper into some problems that can occur and how we can fix them.\nIf you found it valuable, please consider sharing it, as it might also be valuable to others.

Since I was introduced to Eclipse for Java at my university a while ago and experienced the terror, I was looking for alternatives and I found Intellij. I use it all the time, and it's definitely my favorite IDE. All the other Jetbrains products such as PyCharm and WebStorm are also on the same high standard.\n\nIn this short article I'm going to go through what kind of good commands you could use to maximize your development experience with the IDE to get more productive.\nSearch\nThe search functionality is great in IntelliJ. To open up the quick search press:\nSHIFT + SHIFT and you will get up a popup like this.\n\n  \n\nHere you can enter in class name, file, method, field and much more and it will display it and you can move the arrows up and down and press enter to go to the location easily.\nYou can also add / to see available commands such as searching for plugins with /plugins and move your cursor up and down and enable/disable.\nAnd also there is option to change the behaviour of your editor by enable/disable features.\n\n  \n\nThere is a bunch of commands here so I won't cover all of them. But those are useful ones.\nSearch for everything in the&nbsp;project\n\n  \n\nSometimes you want to search for strings or something inside a file to do that I usually use:\nOS X\nCMD + SHIFT + F\nWindows\nCTRL + SHIFT + F\nLinux\nCTRL + SHIFT + F\nGo to implementation\nLets say that you are on your interface or anywhere in the source code that uses a method, but you want to go to that code to see how it works under the hood.\n\n  \n\nTo do that you could simply put your cursor as in this example on the interface method name and press the following.\nOS X\nCMD + OPTION + b\nWindows\nCTRL + ALT + b\nLinux\nCTRL + ALT + b\nThis will take you to the actual code in DaemonBasic class that implements that method.\n\n  \n\nGo to declaration\nTo go to an actual usage of the method where it is declared you can do as you did before but this time press the following.\nOS X\nCMD + b\nWindows\nCTRL + b\nLinux\nCTRL + b\n\n  \n\nGo to last/previous cursor&nbsp;position\nThis is very nice feature, let's say you are standing like on the previous file and you want to go back where you were looking at before. You can simply press the following.\nOS X\nCMD + OPTION + LEFT\nWindows\nCTRL + ALT + LEFT\nLinux\nCTRL + ALT + LEFT\nYou change left with right arrow if you want to go forward.\nCollapse/expand all code&nbsp;blocks\n\n  \n\nSometimes I like to just collapse all the code blocks to get an overview. This can be done by pressing the following.\nOS X\nCMD + SHIFT (-)\nWindows\nCTRL + SHIFT (-)\nLinux\nCTRL + SHIFT (-)\nTo expand all code blocks again just change minus to plus.\nRenaming\nFor some reason I have always been right clicking and selecting refactor &gt; rename in IntelliJ, it's clearly displaying the shortcut there, but whatever. By the user named Ahmedouyahya he/she recommended me here in the comment section of the shortcut so I edited this article now and added this.\nOS X\nSHIFT + F6\nWindows\nSHIFT + F6\nLinux\nSHIFT + F6\n\n  \n\nBrowse recent&nbsp;files\nIf you are like me I usually have multiple files open. Sometimes more than can fit the tab bar. So what I usually use is to browse recent files.\nOS X\nCMD + E\nWindows\nCTRL + E\nLinux\nCTRL + E\n\n  \n\nSummary\nEvery day I discover something new in IntelliJ IDEA that helps a lot for my productivity.\nI hope this helped you and if you find these articles interesting, please follow me here for upcoming tutorials and consider follow me on my social medias below. I am thinking of doing a separate tutorial on how to use IntelliJ for debugging.\nIf you found it valuable, please consider sharing it, as it might also be valuable to others.
